Long term goals:
- Better keyboard input
	- Read from file as <input> : <keycombo>
		- e.g. "Build-worker : C-b"
	- Modifier key support
		- i.e. a bind might be "C-A-b" or "CA-b" (ctrl-alt-b)
	- Instead of checking if a key is down or not, the engine keeps track of keyinputs done since last frame.
- Window based UI
	- Movable windows within the game with support for images, text and buttons.
